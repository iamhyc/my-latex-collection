\section{Motivation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Distributed Edge Scenario. We need information sharing among agents, to achieve better system performance than local greedy policy. \hl{Argue that local greedy is bad.}
    \item However, in a distributed system, latency and synchronization is impossible to implement frequently and precisely. The latency causes stale information sharing. \hl{Lemma: fixed one agent, the one wold adopt sub-optimal policy before receiving the information. A.k.a, sub optimal plus optimal is not optimal in that interval.}
    \item Lemma: To argue for estimation error of latency, when the length of broadcast interval/arrival intensity increases, the estimation error would be increasing with $O(N \times M \times J)$.
    \item Lemma: To argue for sampling error, the periodic-sampled cost is already a good estimation for JCT (Job Completion Time), while the parameters of model is learnt with the minimum time scale (i.e. the time slot).
    \item Moreover, the latency is further stochastic due to the underlaid network, which is hard to tackle. And that's why we develop stochastic latency-aware RL algorithm.
    \item Insight: We only do \emph{latency-aware} instead of \emph{latency-adapt} policy, so what insight could we get?
    \item Insight2: The bottleneck may exists in \emph{Barrel Theory} that one lack agent could ruin the whole cooperation. (Really?)
