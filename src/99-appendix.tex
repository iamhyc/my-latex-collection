\section{Value Function Analysis and Approximation}
\label{apped_1}
In this section, we elaborate the method to approximate the Bellman's equation in Eqn (\ref{eqn:sp_0}).

Firstly, we notice that the transition function in Eqn (\ref{eqn:sp_0}) could be rewrite in the following form.
\begin{align}
    & \Pr\Brace{ \Stat_{k}(t+1)|\Stat_{k}(t), \Omega_{k}(\Stat_{k}(t)) }
    \nonumber\\
    =& \prod_{j\in\jSpace} \Brace{
        \prod_{k'\in\ccSet_{k}}\prod_{m\in\esSet_{k}} \Pr\big\{
            \vec{R}^{(k')}_{m,j}(t+1) | \vec{R}^{(k')}_{m,j}(t), \Omega_{k}(\Stat_{k}(t))
        \big\}
        \nonumber\\
        &\times \prod_{m\in\esSet_{k}} \Pr\big\{
            Q_{m,j}(t+1) | Q_{m,j}(t), \Omega_{k}(\Stat_{k}(t))
        \big\}
    },
\end{align}
where the transition function is decoupled into two parts of state transition on APs and edge servers, respectively.
To efficiently express the state transition, we further elaborate the distribution probability of the state vector as the corresponding probability vector, and perform the state transition with the transition matrix.

%NOTE: transition matrix and vector for AP
\begin{definition}[Denotation of Transition on AP]
    Let $\vecG{\Theta}^{(k)}_{m,j}(t,n)$ and ${\Gamma}^{(k)}_{m,j}(t,n)$ be the probability vector and transition matrix of $\vec{R}^{(k)}_{m,j}(t,n)$ at the $n$-th time slot in the $t$-th broadcast interval, respectively ($\forall k\in\apSet, m\in\esSet, j\in\jSpace$).
    \begin{align}
        \Gamma^{(k)}_{m,j}(t,n) &\define
        \begin{bmatrix}
            1 & \bar{p}^{(k)}_{m,j,0} &                       &        &                           \\
            & 0                     & \bar{p}^{(k)}_{m,j,1} &        &                           \\
            &                       & \ddots                & \ddots &                           \\
            &                       &                       & \ddots & \bar{p}^{(k)}_{m,j,\Xi-1} \\
            &                       &                       &        & 0                         \\
        \end{bmatrix},
        \\
        \vecG{\Theta}^{(k)}_{m,j}(t,n) &\define
        \Bracket{ \theta^{(k)}_{m,j,0}(t,n), \theta^{(k)}_{m,j,1}(t,n), \dots, \theta^{(k)}_{m,j,\Xi}(t,n) },
        % \begin{bmatrix}
        %     \theta^{(k)}_{m,j,0}(t,n) \\
        %     \theta^{(k)}_{m,j,1}(t,n) \\
        %     \vdots \\
        %     \vdots \\
        %     \theta^{(k)}_{m,j,\Xi}(t,n)
        % \end{bmatrix},
    \end{align}
    where $\theta^{(k)}_{m,j,\xi}(t,n)$ and $\bar{p}^{(k)}_{m,j,\xi}$ denote the probability of existing and offloading, respectively ($\forall \xi=0,\dots,\Xi$).
    \begin{align}
        \theta^{(k)}_{m,j,\xi}(t,n) &\define \Pr\{R^{(k)}_{m,j,\xi}(t,n) = 1\}
        \\
        p^{(k)}_{m,j,\xi} &\define \Pr\{U^{(k)}_{m,j} < (\xi+1) | U^{(k)}_{m,j}>\xi\}
        \\
        \bar{p}^{(k)}_{m,j,\xi} &= 1 - p^{(k)}_{m,j,\xi}.
    \end{align}
    And we note that $\theta^{(k)}_{m,j,0}(t,n)$ is purely determined by the arrival process and dispatching policy of the $j$-th type of job on the $k$-th AP, i.e. $\theta^{(k)}_{m,j,0}(t,n) = \lambda_{k,j} I[\omega_{k,j}(t) = m]$, where $I[\cdot]$ is the indicator function.

    Let $\hat{\vecG{\Theta}}^{(k)}_{m,j}(t)$ denote the probability vector at the first time slot of the $t$-th broadcast interval.
    Hence, the state transition between adjacent interval from $\hat{\vecG{\Theta}}^{(k)}_{m,j}(t+1)$ to $\hat{\vecG{\Theta}}^{(k)}_{m,j}(t)$ is composed of two-phase policy separated by $D_k(t)$, which could be expressed as follows.
    \begin{align}
        \vecG{\Theta}^{(k)}_{m,j}(t, \mathcal{D}_{k}(t)) &= (\Gamma^{(k)}_{m,j})^{\mathcal{D}_{k}(t)} \times \hat{\vecG{\Theta}}_{m,j}(t),
        \nonumber\\
        \hat{\vecG{\Theta}}^{(k)}_{m,j}(t+1) &= (\Gamma^{(k)}_{m,j})^{N-\mathcal{D}_{k}(t)} \times \vecG{\Theta}^{(k)}_{m,j}(t, \mathcal{D}_{k}(t)).
    \end{align}
\end{definition}

%NOTE: small probability approximation
% The expression of transition matrix $P_{m,j}$ is more complex.
The transition happening on edge servers is affect by the arrival process from APs.
Hence, we first denote the offloading matrix $\bar{\Gamma}^{(k)}_{m,j}$ from each AP to the $m$-th edge server and the offloading number vector $\vecG{\rho}^{(k,+)}_{m,j}({t,n})$ as follows, respectively ($\forall k\in\apSet, m\in\esSet_{m}, j\in\jSpace$).
\begin{align}
    \bar{\Gamma}^{(k)}_{m,j}(t,n) &\define
    \begin{bmatrix}
        0 & p^{(k)}_{m,j,0} &                 &        &                     \\
        & 0               & p^{(k)}_{m,j,1} &        &                     \\
        &                 & \ddots          & \ddots &                     \\
        &                 &                 & \ddots & p^{(k)}_{m,j,\Xi-1} \\
        &                 &                 &        & 1                   \\
    \end{bmatrix},
    \\
    \vecG{\rho}^{(k,+)}_{m,j}({t,n}) &\define \bar{\Gamma}^{(k)}_{m,j} \times \vecG{\theta}^{(k)}_{m,j}({t,n}).
\end{align}
The combinations of all the offloading number vector for the $m$-th edge server from its \emph{potential AP set} would be unacceptable.
Thus we rewrite the arrival process on edge server with small probability approximation, i.e. there would be at most one job arriving in one time slot, with the probability as the expected arrival rate of the original distribution.
The explicit definition of the approximate arriving probability $\beta_{m,j}({t,n})$ is given as follows.
\begin{align}
    {\beta}_{m,j}({t,n}) &\define \sum_{k\in\apSet} \sum_{\xi=0,\dots,\Xi-1} \mathbb{E}[\vecG{\rho}^{(k,+)}_{m,j,\xi}({t,n})]
    \label{eqn_0}
\end{align}
\begin{lemma}[Small Probability Approximation]
    The probability distribution of $\sum_{k\in\apSet} \vecG{\rho}^{(k,+)}_{m,j}({t,n})$ could be approximated with a Bernoulli arrival process who is with the expected arrival rate denoted as ${\beta}_{m,j}({t,n})$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    % We notice that the job arrival distribution ${\beta}_{m,j}(t)$ is given by $\mathcal{R}(t)$, and the departure rate in one slot is deterministic as $1/N$.
    % Thus the expectation of ${\beta}$ would be always far more smaller than $1$ as composed of all $K$ AP nodes.
    % We take approximation on ${\beta}$ as Bernoulli distribution in each time slot.
\end{proof}

%NOTE: transition matrix and vector for Edge Server
Thus we could obtain the denotation of transition matrix and probability vector for edge servers.
\begin{definition}[Denotation of Transition on Edge Server]
    Let $\vecG{\mu}_{m,j}(t,n)$ and $P_{m,j}$ denote the probability vector and transition matrix of $Q_{m,j}(t,n)$ at the $n$-th time slot in the $t$-th broadcast interval, respectively ($\forall m\in\esSet, j\in\jSpace$).
    \begin{align}
        \vecG{\mu}_{m,j}(t,n) \define [\Pr\{Q_{m,j}=0\}, \dots, \Pr\{Q_{m,j}=L_{max}\}].
    \end{align}

    Let $\hat{\vecG{\nu}}_{m,j}(t)$ denote the probability vector at the first time slot of the $t$-th broadcast interval.
    The time-variant transition matrix composed of multiple transition matrix $P_{m,j}(\beta({t,n}))$ in all the time slots in $i$-th interval as follows.
    \begin{align}
        \vecG{\nu}({t,n+1}) &= P_{m,j}\Paren{\beta_{m,j}({t,n})} \vecG{\nu}({t,n})
        % \label{eqn_3}
        \\
        \hat{\vecG{\nu}}(t+1) &= \prod_{n=0,\dots,N-1} P_{m,j}\Paren{\beta_{m,j}({t,n})} \hat{\vecG{\nu}}(t),
        \label{eqn_4}
    \end{align}
\end{definition}

According to the additive structure of cost function, we substitute the transition function plus value function in Eqn (\ref{eqn:sp_0}) under some \emph{fixed policy} $\Pi_{k}$ with two linearly sections as $W^{\AP}_{\Pi_{k}}(\mathcal{R}(t+1))$ and $W^{\ES}_{\Pi_{k}}(\mathcal{Q}(t+1))$ for APs and edge servers, respectively.
