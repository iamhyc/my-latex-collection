\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we consider the cooperative job dispatching problem in an edge computing network residing in a MAN with multiple APs and edge servers.
The APs and edge servers periodically broadcast their local state information to facilitate distributive dispatchers design.
The new challenges is addressed to the cooperation of distributive dispatcher design that significant signaling overhead and random transmission latency causes the inconsistency of system information at different dispatchers.
We formulate the distributive optimization of job dispatching strategies at all the APs as a POMDP, whose minimization objective is a discount measurement of job delivery and computation delay.
We propose a novel low-complexity distributive solution framework based on one-step policy iteration, where the complicated POMDP solution or value iteration is avoided.
The analytical performance lower bound is derived.
The evaluation results show that the proposed solution framework outperforms various benchmarks in average JCT and average job throughput.
The sensitivity study shows the robustness of algorithm in sensitivity study with various parameter settings.
In the future work, we shall improve the execution efficiency of the algorithm and implement it in the real-time online system.
