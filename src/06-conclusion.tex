\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we consider the cooperative job dispatching problem in an edge computing network residing in a MAN with multiple APs and edge servers.

In the future work, we shall improve the execution efficiency of the algorithm and implement it in the real online system.
