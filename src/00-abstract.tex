    Edge computing is believed to be the solid solution for time-sensitive big data real-time calculation. The cooperation among edge servers in the system usually causes in-effective task scheduling due to obsolete information sharing which is hard to tackle.
    In this work, we formulate the problem with job dispatching in distributed Edge Computing system, and identify the difficulty exists in cooperation among AP nodes (Access Points) and ES nodes (Edge Servers) with delayed information. We design the broadcast information sharing scheme in the system and formulate the corresponding problem into a MDP problem. The value function approximation and one-step policy iteration method is adopted to obtain a sub-optimal dispatching policy whose performance can be bounded analytically.
