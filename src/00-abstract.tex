    Edge computing is believed to be the solid solution for increasing computation-intensive and energy-hungry applications on mobile devices.
    The edge server clusters are deployed in closer proximity to mobile devices than cloud infrastructure, which alleviates the communication overhead and enables \emph{time-sensitive} and \emph{deadline-aware} tasks offloading.
    The edge servers are always with limited computation resources standalone, and efficient cooperation is indispensable among distributed servers.
    However, due to intensive job arrival and unpredictable latency, the effect of stale information sharing would cause severe jobs misplacement and over-submission.

    In this work, we formulate the job dispatching problem in distributed Edge Computing system, and identify that the difficulty exists in how the decision is made decentralized based on stale information sharing.
    A periodic information sharing scheme via broadcast is proposed, and the standard MDP framework is introduced to depict the latency-aware dispatching process.

        The delicately designed low-complexity algorithm is adopted to provide an approximation solution against curse of dimensionality and with bounded analytical performance guarantee.
        The value function approximation and one-step policy iteration method is adopted to obtain a sub-optimal dispatching policy whose performance can be bounded analytically.
