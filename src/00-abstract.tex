    Edge computing is believed to be the solid solution for increasing time-sensitive and real-time applications.
    The edge server clusters are deployed in close proximity to edge devices, which alleviate the communication overhead but with limited computation resources compared with cloud infrastructure.
    And the cooperation among decentralized edge servers could suffer from \emph{outdated decisions} due to obsolete information sharing and leads to in-effective task scheduling.

    In this work, we formulate the problem with job dispatching in distributed Edge Computing system, and identify the difficulty exists in cooperation among AP nodes (Access Points) and ES nodes (Edge Servers) with delayed information.
    We design the information sharing scheme via broadcast in the system and formulate the corresponding problem under standard MDP framework.
    The delicately designed low-complexity algorithm is adopted to provide an approximation solution against curse of dimensionality and with bounded analytical performance guarantee.
    % The value function approximation and one-step policy iteration method is adopted to obtain a sub-optimal dispatching policy whose performance can be bounded analytically.
