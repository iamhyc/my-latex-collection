\section{Performance Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}
In this section, we evaluate the performance of the proposed low-complexity dispatching policy $\tilde{\Policy}$ by numerical simulations.
The experiment setup and performance benchmarks are elaborated in Section \ref{subsec:setup}.
The simulation results are illustrated in Section \ref{subsec:basic}.
The sensitivity study on parameters is also applied to provide some insights on the robustness of the proposed policy in Section \ref{subsec:advance}.

\subsection{Experiment Setup}
\label{subsec:setup}
In the simulation, there are $K=5$ APs, $M=3$ edge servers and $J=5$ type of jobs in the system.
The edge servers are all fully-accessible to all the APs, i.e., $\esSet_{k}=\esSet$ ($\forall k\in\apSet$).

The time slot duration is 50 milliseconds and one broadcast interval consists of $t_{B}=20$ time slots, i.e., its duration is $1$ second.
% The distributions of arrival rate, uploading time and processing time are generated randomly.
The maximum uploading time is $3$ seconds, i.e., $\Xi = 3t_B$, and the distribution of $\mathbb{U}_{k,m,j}(\Xi)$ is arbitrarily generated within the support $[0, \Xi]$.
The expected computation time $c_{m,j}$ is also randomly generated in the range $[30,50]$ with the unit of time slot.

Each queue for VMs on edge server is with maximum queue length $L_{max}=20$, i.e., there would be at most $100$ jobs on one edge server.
The arrival rate is arbitrarily generated around $0.03$ for each AP.
% The arrival rate is taken as small probability with enough APs in the system, and correspondingly enough edge servers for the processing.

\end{figure}                                                                                   %

%NOTE: Benchmark Elaboration
We compare the proposed algorithm with other three heuristic algorithms which are listed as follows. For each type of jobs,
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Random Dispatching Policy}:
            Randomly choose a dispatching edge server in a time slot; 
    \item \textbf{Selfish Algorithm}:
            Always choose the edge server with the minimum expected uploading time together with the expected processing time;
    \item \textbf{Queue-aware Selfish Algorithm}:
            Always choose the edge server with the minimum expected uploading time together with the expected processing time and queueing time based on the observation of outdated queue states.
\end{itemize}
Specifically, we choose the \emph{Selfish Algorithm} which is state-invariant as the initial policy for our proposed algorithm.
The explicit definition is given as follows.
\begin{policy}[Selfish Policy]
    \begin{align}
        \Baseline \define \Brace{ \Pi_{k} |\forall k\in\apSet }, \Pi_{k} \define \Brace{{\pi_{k,j}|\forall j\in\jSpace}}
    \end{align}
    where $\pi_{k,j} \define \arg\min_{m\in\esSet_{k}} u_{k,m,j} + c_{m,j}$.
\end{policy}

%NOTE: Basic Performance
\subsection{Performance Analysis}
\label{subsec:basic}
The evaluation results are shown in Fig.\ref{fig:bar_plot} where three metrics are taken to demonstrate the performance of our proposed algorithm with other benchmarks.
\fixit{
    Average Cost v.s. Algorithms in Fig.\ref{fig:bar_plot}(a);
    Average JCT (job completion time) v.s. Algorithms, Fig.\ref{fig:bar_plot}(b);
    Average Departure Rate (throughput) v.s. Algorithms, Fig.\ref{fig:bar_plot}(c).
}
Specifically, our proposed algorithm is better than compared algorithms all the time in the timeline figure Fig.\ref{fig:brd-timeline}.
The CDF of cost is illustrated in Fig.\ref{fig:cdf_cost} where the cost of \emph{SQF policy} is nearly the same as the \emph{selfish policy}, however, the \emph{SQF policy} actually have very poor job departure rate (, throughput) compared with the other's.
\fixit{
    This is because the broadcast information is periodically and outdated, and SQF could not handle the penalty brought by job rejection properly.
    And we take \emph{CDF of number of jobs} other than \emph{CDF of cost} which could better reflect the performance of the average JCT target in the simulation when job rejection considered.
