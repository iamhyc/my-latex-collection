\section{Performance Evaluation}

\subsection{Parameter Settings}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $K=5$ AP nodes, $M=3$ ES nodes, and $J=5$ type of jobs;
    \item Each time slot with $\tau=0.05$ s (a.k.a $50$ ms), and broadcast interval $T=N\tau$ with $N=20$;
    \item The maximum uploading time is $\Xi = 3 T$, and the maximum broadcast latency is shorter than $T$;
    \item (arrival rate is random generated as $\lambda_{k,j} \ll 1/N$)
    \item job processing time distribution generated from real data trace;
    \item Each queue on ES with maximum 10 jobs.
\end{itemize}

We compare the proposed algorithm with other 3 heuristic algorithms.
Compared Algorithm:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Local greedy algorithm (baseline policy)}:
            not queue-aware and always to the server with minimum average processing time; this policy is taken as the baseline policy as the start of our proposed algorithm;
    \item \textbf{Local queue-aware greedy algorithm}:
            however the queue state is stale;
    \item \textbf{Heuristic queue-aware greedy algorithm}:
            mixed algorithm with baseline policy and stale queue information considered, with weight factor $\alpha = 0.5$;
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance Analysis}
Compared with different parameter settings:
\begin{itemize}
    \item CDF of cost (Average JCT), with different broadcast $T$ setting;
    \item CDF of cost (Average JCT), with different broadcast latency $D$ setting;
\end{itemize}

Compared with other algorithms:
\begin{itemize}
    \item CDF of cost (Average JCT);
    \item CDF of queue length;
    \item CDF of \# of dropped jobs (over the queue limit);
\end{itemize}
